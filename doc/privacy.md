# 🔐 Privacy & Data Policy – PeeragogyBot

We care deeply about your data, your agency, and your trust. Here's how we handle privacy in PeeragogyBot.

## 📅 Session Storage
- All conversations are **session-based**
- No long-term memory
- Sessions are **auto-deleted after 1 hour** via a TTL (Time To Live) index in the database

## 🧠 No AI Memory
- The bot does **not remember** your past messages
- No profiles, no tracking, no history
- Each session is a fresh start

## 🛢️ Data Storage Backend
Depending on deployment, we use either:
- **MongoDB Atlas** (with TTL-enabled collections)
- **Neon PostgreSQL** (session tables wiped hourly)

## 🔍 Logging (Optional)
- Error logs and analytics may be used **only** to improve UX
- No personally identifiable info is ever stored

## 👤 No Accounts Needed
- You can use PeeragogyBot anonymously
- No login, no email, no hassle

## 🔄 Transparency & Open Source
- All source code is public
- You can inspect, fork, or host your own version
