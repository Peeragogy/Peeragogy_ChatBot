# 🧠 PeeragogyBot – Cognitive Loop Wrap Report (2025-04-15)
### Version: v1.3 – First Full Integration with Pyria-API (OpenAI Assistant)

---

## 🔁 What We Achieved Today

### ✅ Cognitive Loop Activated
- Successfully integrated `pyria_loop_full`, a custom Flowise tool that connects PeeragogyBot to **Pyria-API** (OpenAI Assistant).
- The tool performs:
  - Thread creation
  - Message dispatch
  - Run initiation
  - Polling for completion
  - Final message retrieval
  - Automatic thread cleanup
- Enabled full `logging` and `meta` outputs for precise debugging
- Error handling and fallback message in case of failure

---

### 🧰 Flow Structure Refactored
- Removed deprecated tools: `customTool_0`, `_1`, `_2`, and `chainTool_1`
- ToolAgent cleaned and reinforced with `strictToolCalling`
- Updated system message with clear trigger logic for Pyria activation
- Clarified tool descriptions to ensure correct tool selection

---

### 🔐 Engineering Best Practices Implemented
- API Key and Assistant ID handled via `process.env`
- Polling controlled via constants (`MAX_ATTEMPTS`, `POLL_INTERVAL`)
- Logs trace each step, return structure includes diagnostics and assistant metadata

---

### 📦 Outputs Generated
- ✅ `PeeragogyBot_v1.3_Report.md` created and ready for release documentation
- ✅ Updated `Chatflow.json` confirmed and exported as v1.3
- 🔖 Ready for Git tagging (`v1.3`) and public release workflow

---

### 🧭 Next Steps (toward v1.4)
- Visual differentiation of Pyria responses in the UI
- Optional fallback to local Pyria simulation
- Persistent conversation logs with Supabase/Notion
- Metrics and dashboard for tool usage and flows
- Preparation for GPT-4o multimodal agent loop
